Instructions:

1. Opam-
The first step is to install opam, the OCaml package manager. (We will also 
need m4, a tool used by certain packages to preprocess OCaml code). If you 
already have opam installed, you can skip this step.

  On macOS (using Homebrew):
  $ brew install opam

2. Then, initialize opam 

  Initializing Opam:
  $ opam init

You may be asked: "Do you want opam to modify ~/.zshrc? [N/y/f]". If so, enter "y".

You may also be asked: "A hook can be added to opam's init scripts to ensure that 
the shell remains in sync with the opam environment when they are loaded. Set 
that up? [y/N]". Enter "y" again.


3. Next we’ll install a set of basic libraries that you’ll need for this game:
  
  $ opam install async core js_of_ocaml js_of_ocaml-ppx merlin utop ocp-indent

Note that this will also install Core, Jane Street's standard library replacement, 
which expands on Jane Street's Base library and is used extensively in this game.

The libraries below will be used for the graphics in the game.

  $ brew install xquartz

  $ opam install camlimages graphics 

Then, restart your laptop to finish xquartz installation.
  

Troubleshooting-
If terminal provides additional output, we recommend that you install any missing
libraries or update any previous versions (I.e., follow the hints provided by the 
terminal).
